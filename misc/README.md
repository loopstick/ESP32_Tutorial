# Miscellany for Art 385 Interaction Design at USF- Spring 2020

### A bunch of ideas for Project #2

#### (love) compatibility meter
- INPUT
	- temperature sensor
	- temperature sensor
- OUTPUT
  - LED strip
	- sound
- MVP
	- use two temperature sensors to compare the heat of two people's hands
		- output to a strip of LEDs to display "compatibility"
- Nice to Have
  - sound effects
	- output to Processing with super cool animations

#### Fruit Ripeness Detector
- INPUT
	- color sensor
	- light sensor
- OUTPUT
  - LED strip
	- sound
- MVP
		- color sensor to sense color
		- sensor to sense some other measure of Ripeness
		  - moisture/humidity sensor to sense ---?
		  - light sensor to sense -----?
- Nice to Have
	- mechanism to move fruit into place
	- mechanism to sort fruit pieces into ripe and not ripe


#### Temperature Sensor and Fan
- INPUT
	- temperature sensor
	-
- OUTPUT
  - fan motor (with transistor)
	- sound or light?
- MVP
	- temperature sensor data used to trigger fan when hot
		- fan cools sensor			
- Nice to Have
	-
	-


#### Boss Alarm and Screen switcher
	- INPUT
		- IR proximity sensor
		-
	- OUTPUT
	  - screen switcher
		-
	- MVP
		- IR sensor triggers application switch on your computer
		  - so boss doesn't see you surfing the web/facebook/etc		
	- Nice to Have
